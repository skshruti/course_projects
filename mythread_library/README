I have created the userthread.c file in src folder which contains the implementation of myThread library. 
Some test files can be found in the src folder and their targets have been added in the Makefile so they can be run using appropriate targets.
Implementation of queue has been done in the queue.c file.

Functions such as myThread_create(), myThread_join(), myThread_exit(), myThread_self() adn myThread_yield() have been implemented. For scheduling between threads, a function timer() has been created which sends the signal for the current thread to yield and then choose another thread to work with.
